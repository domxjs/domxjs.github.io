# DOMX

`DOMX` is an approach to building modern web applications using the DOM, browser,
and patterns morso than relying on frameworks.

It embraces the unidirectional data flow pattern popularized by `FLUX` and `Redux` but
relies on API's that already exist in the DOM.

## Use Cases
Why would you consider using a state management solution?
In many cases you do not need one.
For simple CRUD applications with little business logic and clear data boundaries
can manage without any added complexities.

There are a few conditions
- Want a slide to consider the use case and benefits 
- Rationalizing complex data structures and flow 
- Centralizing and decoupling data 
- What does that give us 
- Predictable state from many moving parts
